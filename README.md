# Queue Open Source Project
by Madeline Cuozzo, Paul Lockett, and Yojairo Morales
hosted at Google by Alex Lyons and Luisa Lu

# Objective
The goal of our project is to fetch local restaurants nearby, determine how busy a restaurant is through wait times, and display this information to users in a pleasant user interface. Currently, there is not a way to specifically look at locally-owned restaurants. Our project hopes to be able to help local restaurants during an economic downturn through garnering more support through online commerce, while providing customers with an enriching searching and ordering experience.
